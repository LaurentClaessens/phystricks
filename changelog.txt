## Problem

The test picture `XOLB` had a non-deterministic behaviour. This was probably
due to a cancelation error: we were substracting two numbers of order of
magnitude 22000 with a differences like 0.01. The 12th decimal was
non-deterministic (change when restarting Sage).

This was impacting the computation of the bounding box of the function and
then the axes.

## Solution.

When computing the X and Y coordinates of the representative points of a
curve, we consider a numerical approximation with `prec=30` in order to get
less digits than the correct ones.

See `GenericCurve.get_minmax_data`.

## Better test recall, June 19, 2017

The module 'TestRecall' is improved and furnish 
- a way to know if the difference between two files are only small move
  of points
- a way to check all '.pstricks' of a directory at once.



## Point coordinates precision, June 15, 2017

### Problem

I found too many cancellation errors here and there in the code. This leads to 
non-deterministic final '.pstricks' file : there is some variation like on the
12th decimal of the coordinates of some points.

The last one I found is in `AngleMeasure.measure :`
```
return AngleMeasure(value_degree=self.angleF.degree-self.angleI.degree)
```

In the picture FBTC the difference is
`206.565051177078- 341.565051177078` which leads to problems.


### Solution (partial)

Make write only 5 digits in the coordinates of the central point of a mark.
    
### Side effect

Many `.recall` files to be redone.


## Polygon parameters, June 15, 2017

### Problem

There are three different things in a polygon : its edges, its filling and its 
hatching.

From now on a polygon had only its `parameters` attribute (from
`GraphOfAnObject`), and we were making some complicated guessing. 
Also the attribute `segment_model` was not really sexy.

### Solution

Now we have three attributes :
* edges_parameters
* hatch_parameters
* fill_parameters

### Side effects

Have to rewrite the functions in which the color of a polygon is customosed.
Also the ones in which a polygon is hatched or filled.


## Non deterministic function evaluation, June 15, 2017

### Problem

The test picture `XOLB` had a non-deterministic behaviour. This was probably
due to a cancelation error: we were substracting two numbers of order of
magnitude 22000 with a differences like 0.01. The 12th decimal was
non-deterministic (change when restarting Sage).

This was impacting the computation of the bounding box of the function and
then the axes.

### Solution.

When computing the X and Y coordinates of the representative points of a
curve, we consider a numerical approximation with `prec=30` in order to get
less digits than the correct ones.

See `GenericCurve.get_minmax_data`.


### Side effects

The 6th or 7th decimal of some bounding boxes are changed. So the axes of some
pictures are changed (not visible).
The `recall` files of these pictures have to be recreated to take that into
account.

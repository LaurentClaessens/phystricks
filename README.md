# phystricks : use python to create your pictures to be inserted in LaTeX

## General introduction

The purpose of this module is to produce pictures to be inserted in your LaTeX document using only python and [Sage](http://sagemath.org) techniques. The motto is :

«*if Sage can compute it, LaTeX can draw it*» 



### Create your own picture

In order to be tested, the naming scheme is quite rigid. Do whatever you want, but the script `new_picture.py` will pick a random name and create all the skeleton files you need.

# TESTING

The script `testing.sh` launches a sequence of tests. We are now giving some descriptions of them.

## Unit testing

The script `unit_tests/unit_tests.sh` launches some unit tests. These are tests for some individual functions.

## Demonstration

The directory `demonstration` contains the source of a demonstration file that has a double purpose : 
- create the file [phystricks-demo.pdf](http://laurent.claessens-donadello.eu/pdf/phystricks-demo.pdf) which demonstrates the possibilities of `phystricks`
- use these pictures as "integration" tests.

We are now describing more in details the second point.

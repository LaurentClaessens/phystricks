There are two non working test pictures. We are dealing with them here.

The problem is that for some reason the computation of the bounding box of the axes
is non deterministic.

# passes

In `figures_demo`, create three lists of figures instead of one.

- The first one contains all of them
- The second one contains only the pictures which need two compilation passes
- The third one contains only the pictures which need three compilation passes

Then the script `testing.sh` will launch `figures_demo` three times with 
a parameter indicating the list to be used.
The aim is to compile each picture only the right number of time. This should reduce the 
test time.

# minmax

Make less use of the Sage'function `get_minmax_data` which leads to indeterministic results.

# newTests

Add to the test suite the pictures that do not compile in mazhe and smath.

# devel

The development branch.
